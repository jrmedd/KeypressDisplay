# Keypress display

I knocked this Chrome extensionup in a couple of hours to help me with documenting UI functionality.  I get asked all the time what keyboard functionality is/should be available in mock-ups and prototypes, so I've mad an extension that overlays a keyboard on a web page.

## Installation

I've submitted the extension for approval on the Chrome extension store. until it's accepted you can just clone this repo, hit developer mode on the [Chrome extensions page](chrome://extensions) and "load unpacked extension".
